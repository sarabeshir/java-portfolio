# â˜• Java Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of Java projects developed in **jGRASP** as part of my coursework at **George Mason University**.  
Each project demonstrates key programming skills such as user input, conditionals, loops, arithmetic operations, and real-world logic applied to business and data scenarios.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
- Java SE (JDK)
- jGRASP IDE
- Scanner class for user input
- Conditional and looping structures
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Debugging and code organization

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### [Addition Quiz](./AdditionQuizWhile/AdditionQuizWhile.java)
An interactive math quiz that repeatedly asks users to solve addition problems until they choose to stop.  
**Skills:** Loops (`while`), user input, arithmetic operations, and control flow.

---

### [Chinese Zodiac](./ChineseZodiac/ChineseZodiac.java)
Determines a userâ€™s Chinese Zodiac sign based on their birth year using the modulus operator.  
**Skills:** Conditional statements, modular arithmetic, user interaction.

---

### [Leap Year Checker](./LeapYear/LeapYear.java)
Determines whether a given year is a leap year using Boolean logic and nested conditionals.  
**Skills:** `if-else` logic, Boolean expressions, and arithmetic decision-making.

---

### [Grade Converter](./GradeConverter/GradeConverter.java)
Converts numerical grades to letter grades with descriptive output.  
**Skills:** Decision-making (`if-else`), data validation, and formatted output.

---

### [Unit Conversion](./UnitConversion/UnitConversion.java)
Converts between various units (e.g., meters to feet, Celsius to Fahrenheit).  
**Skills:** Arithmetic operations, user input with `Scanner`, and formatted display.  
**Use Case:** Demonstrates applied problem-solving relevant to business and data systems.

---

### [Clock In/Out Practice](./ClockInOutPractice/ClockInOutPractice.java)
Simulates an employee time-tracking system where users clock in and out.  
**Skills:** Conditional logic, loops, string handling, and structured decision-making.  
**Use Case:** Reflects time management and logic tracking used in workplace systems.

---

### [Employee Info Practice](./EmployeeInfoPractice/EmployeeInfoPractice.java)
Collects and displays employee information including names, positions, and hours worked.  
**Skills:** Variable management, string handling, and user input/output.  
**Use Case:** Mimics data collection and display logic found in HR or MIS applications.
